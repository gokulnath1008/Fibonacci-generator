Explanation:
fibonacci_generator() Function:
Initializes two variables, a and b, to 0 and 1, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
Enters an infinite while True loop to generate the sequence indefinitely.
The yield a statement returns the current value of a (the next Fibonacci number) and pauses the function's execution.
The values of a and b are updated to calculate the next Fibonacci number.
When next() is called on the generator object, the function resumes from where it left off, executing until the next yield statement.
Example Usage:
fib_gen = fibonacci_generator() creates a generator object.
The for loop iterates 10 times, calling next(fib_gen) each time to get the next Fibonacci number from the generator.
Each Fibonacci number is printed to the console.
Key Concepts:
Generator: A function that uses the yield keyword to return values one at a time, pausing its execution between calls.
yield Keyword: Used to return a value from a generator function without terminating it.
next() Function: Used to get the next value from a generator.
Infinite Sequence: The while True loop allows the generator to produce an infinite sequence, but you can control how many numbers to get from it in your code.
